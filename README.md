# ðŸ”’ Smart Face Recognition Security System

## Project Overview
[cite_start]This project details the design and implementation of an **embedded, face recognition-based security system** that leverages the **ESP32 microcontroller** for real-time monitoring and remote alerts[cite: 513, 514]. [cite_start]The system is engineered to enhance security by identifying and verifying individuals through facial recognition, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access[cite: 518]. [cite_start]The **ESP32**, with its built-in Wi-Fi and processing power, serves as the central controller, enabling seamless communication between hardware and the web interface[cite: 519].

## ðŸ’» Face Recognition Methodology (Python/OpenCV)

The core of the system is a face recognition pipeline implemented using **Python** and the **OpenCV** library.

### 1. Data Collection & Face Detection
* [cite_start]A Python script captures face images using a webcam[cite: 526, 542].
* [cite_start]The **Haar cascade classifier** is employed to detect faces in real-time from the webcam feed[cite: 531, 606, 607].
* [cite_start]To ensure high accuracy, **$1000$ images per person** are captured[cite: 532, 610]. [cite_start]Images are taken under different lighting, angles, and expressions for robustness[cite: 544].
* [cite_start]Captured images are converted to **grayscale** to reduce complexity and improve processing speed[cite: 545, 527]. [cite_start]Each face is then labeled appropriately[cite: 528, 546].

### 2. Model Training
* [cite_start]The system uses the **LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) face recognizer** for training[cite: 558, 623].
* [cite_start]Images from the dataset are loaded and **resized to a uniform size** (e.g., $400 \times 400$ pixels)[cite: 558, 621].
* [cite_start]The trained model is saved as an **XML file** (e.g., `face_model.xml`) for use in real-time recognition[cite: 559, 627].

### 3. Real-Time Recognition
* [cite_start]The system loads the trained model to detect and analyze faces in real-time[cite: 637].
* **Access Control Logic:**
    * [cite_start]**Authorized Access:** If a match is found against the database, access is granted[cite: 521, 658].
    * [cite_start]**Unauthorised Personnel:** If an unknown face is encountered, it immediately **triggers an alert mechanism**[cite: 640].
    * [cite_start]**Uncertain Match:** If a recognized face's confidence level falls below a predefined threshold (e.g., 50), the system considers it an uncertain match[cite: 639].

## ðŸ“¡ ESP32 Integration and Alerts

The ESP32 is used for real-time monitoring, status updates, and remote alerts.

### 1. Communication
* [cite_start]The Python script facilitates communication between the face recognition system and the ESP32 using **PySerial**[cite: 565].
* [cite_start]The script sends the identification results (**"Authorized: [Name]"** or **"Intruder"**) to the ESP32[cite: 657, 817, 815].

### 2. Monitoring & Alerts
* [cite_start]The ESP32 uses its built-in Wi-Fi to host a **web interface** for real-time monitoring and status display[cite: 522, 849, 850, 711].
* [cite_start]If an **"Intruder"** is detected, the ESP32 triggers an alert, notifying users remotely via services like **Blynk** (e.g., email/mobile notifications)[cite: 521, 550, 640, 777, 858, 874]. [cite_start]The web interface status is updated to reflect the alert[cite: 712, 851].

## ðŸ“ˆ Conclusion

[cite_start]This project successfully combines face recognition technology with the ESP32 microcontroller, yielding an effective security system[cite: 899]. [cite_start]With real-time monitoring and alerts, it enhances access control, providing a reliable solution for modern security needs[cite: 900].
