# üîí Smart Face Recognition Security System

## üìò Project Overview
This project details the design and implementation of an **embedded, face recognition-based security system** that leverages the **ESP32 microcontroller** for real-time monitoring and remote alerts.  

The system is engineered to enhance security by identifying and verifying individuals through facial recognition, thereby reducing the risk of unauthorized access.  
The **ESP32**, with its built-in Wi-Fi and processing power, serves as the central controller, enabling seamless communication between hardware and the web interface.

## üíª Face Recognition Methodology (Python/OpenCV)

The core of the system is a face recognition pipeline implemented using **Python** and the **OpenCV** library.

### 1. Data Collection & Face Detection
- A Python script captures face images using a webcam.  
- The **Haar cascade classifier** is employed to detect faces in real-time from the webcam feed.  
- To ensure high accuracy, **1000 images per person** are captured under different lighting, angles, and expressions for robustness.  
- Captured images are converted to **grayscale** to reduce complexity and improve processing speed.  
- Each face is labeled appropriately for training.

### 2. Model Training
- The system uses the **LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms)** face recognizer for training.  
- Images from the dataset are loaded and **resized to a uniform size** (e.g., `400 √ó 400` pixels).  
- The trained model is saved as an **XML file** (e.g., `face_model.xml`) for use in real-time recognition.

### 3. Real-Time Recognition
- The system loads the trained model to detect and analyze faces in real-time.  

**Access Control Logic:**
- ‚úÖ **Authorized Access:** If a match is found in the database, access is granted.  
- üö´ **Unauthorized Personnel:** If an unknown face is detected, the system **triggers an alert mechanism**.  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Uncertain Match:** If the confidence level falls below a threshold (e.g., 50), it is marked as uncertain.

## üì° ESP32 Integration and Alerts

The **ESP32** is used for real-time monitoring, system status updates, and remote alert notifications.

### 1. Communication
- The Python script communicates with the ESP32 using **PySerial**.  
- It sends identification results such as **"Authorized: [Name]"** or **"Intruder"** to the ESP32.

### 2. Monitoring & Alerts
- The ESP32 uses its built-in Wi-Fi to host a **web interface** for real-time status display.  
- If an **"Intruder"** is detected:
  - The ESP32 triggers an alert and sends notifications via **Blynk** (e.g., email or mobile).  
  - The web interface status is updated immediately to reflect the alert condition.

## üìà Conclusion

This project successfully combines **face recognition** with the **ESP32 microcontroller**, creating an effective, real-time **security and access control system**.  
With features like remote alerts and intelligent recognition, it provides a reliable and scalable solution for modern security needs.
